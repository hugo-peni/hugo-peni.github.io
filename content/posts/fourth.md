The EPFL carbon team is a student team from EPFL whose primary goal is to build a Direct Air Capture Machine (DAC)

## Presentation of our Direct Air Capture (DAC) Project

My team and I were tasked with building a Direct Air Capture (DAC) system using activated charcoal absorbents. Although we werenâ€™t directly involved in manufacturing the absorbents, we focused on designing an automated reactor for continuous carbon capture. This involved mechanical tasks, such as assembling pipes, valves, and columns, as well as integrating electronics like sensors and a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) for system control.
