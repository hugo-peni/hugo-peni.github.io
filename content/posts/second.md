I was hired at the Reconfigurable Robotics Lab to support PhD candidate Mustafa Mete’s research, focusing on the manufacturing and testing of origami robots, along with the design and assembly of printed circuit boards.

# Multi-layer Fabrication

I was tasked with manufacturing an origami arm using a multi-layer fabrication process. This method involved laser-cutting FRA and Kapton sheets, then bonding them through heat press curing. The result was a set of sophisticated mechanical joints, eliminating the need for traditional hinges or bearings.

# PCB Design and Assembly

I also designed and assembled PCBs to serve as sensor platforms for an origami-inspired robotic arm, integrating electronic components with the arm’s flexible structure.
